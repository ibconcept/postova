✨ Core Functionalities Deep Dive/generate: AI-Assisted Poster CreationReceives user-provided text, image (or URL), and selected styling options.Leverages AI to refine layout, suggest optimal aesthetics, and then renders the final poster image. This process might involve calling Supabase Edge Functions for server-side AI processing./summarize-url: Intelligent Article Content ExtractionTakes a news article URL as input.Uses advanced AI (potentially via a Supabase Edge Function) to browse the URL, extract the primary content (text and images), and then intelligently summarize the text into a concise, poster-friendly format./upload: Direct Image & Content IntegrationAllows users to directly upload their own images to be incorporated into the poster design, securely stored via Supabase Storage.(Future) Integrates OCR (possibly via a Supabase Edge Function) to automatically read and format text from uploaded image documents.📦 Deployment OptionsPostova is designed for flexible and cost-effective deployment, ensuring your posters can be generated and shared globally.PlatformNotesNetlifyIdeal for deploying the static Vite + React frontend. Offers continuous deployment from Git, global CDN, and custom domains.SupabaseHosts your PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, and serverless Edge Functions. Integrates seamlessly with the frontend.VercelAnother strong option for static frontend deployment, similar to Netlify, with great developer experience.DockerOptional Docker setup for frontend for full environment control and consistent deployments across platforms. (Supabase handles its own infrastructure).🔐 Environment VariablesEnsure these environment variables are set correctly for the application to function.# Frontend .env (typically in frontend/.env)
